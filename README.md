### Motivation/Purpose

The Freedom Index is a metric used to measure the level of freedom enjoyed by individuals in a country. This index is calculated using a number of factors, including political rights, civil liberties, and economic freedom. Over time, the level of freedom enjoyed by individuals in different countries around the world has changed significantly. While some countries have become more democratic and free, others have become more authoritarian and oppressive.

To better understand the relationship between democracy and economic prosperity, we use data from Freedom House that measures democratization across the world based on GDP per Capita data from 2006 to 2022. Additionally, we analyze the relationship between regions and the average freedom index in those regions to determine if a country's location is a significant factor in its freedom level. Finally, we assess countries classified as free and what they have in common that allows them to have a higher freedom index. Through analyzing multiple nations' freedom index, we aim to gain insight into the factors that contribute to a country's level of freedom.

Our data is named Freedom in the World and was first obtained through the open source data project tidytuesday . Arthur Cheib constructed the dataset, however the data he gathered came from the United Nations and Freedom House. The dataset is simply a collection of nations with data spanning from 2005 to 2021 that show whether a country is free or not, covering factors such as the country name, region, status, civil freedoms, political rights, total freedom index, GDP, and GDP per Capita!

### Research Questions

1) We hope to assess the relationship between democracy and economic prosperity. We make this assessment using Freedom House data which measures democratization across the world based on GDP per Capita Data. This data is from 2006 to 2022.

2) We hope to assess the relationship between regions and the average freedom index in those regions to analyze whether a region a country is in is a significant factor to determining its freedom level.

3) We hope to assess countries that are classified as free and what these countries have that are allowing them to have a higher freedom index. We hope to assess the relationship between countries and the freedom index through out certain years and analyze multiple nation's freedom index to other nations.

We believe that these questions can help us find a pattern as to where the most freedom is found and what factors those countries with higher freedom index have that the lower freedom index countries don't.
